(** Logical relational-algebra IR.

    The logical IR is the layer between the surface AST and the physical
    operators that {!Eval} executes. Logical operators describe *what* a query
    computes — read these rows, keep these columns, join on this predicate —
    without committing to *how*. {!Translate} lowers logical operators into a
    physical plan that picks an execution strategy.

    Slice 1 ships only [Scan]; further logical operators arrive as later slices
    introduce them. *)

type t =
  | Scan of { table : string }
      (** [Scan { table }] reads every row of [table]. The logical operator
          carries no execution detail; it's the [Translate] layer's job to pick
          between full-scan, index-scan, and so on. *)
