(** Surface AST for the relational-algebra query language.

    The AST is the structure produced by the {!Parser} from a textual query. It
    mirrors the surface syntax: every node corresponds to something the user
    typed, and nothing more. {!Lower} converts the AST into a logical plan,
    where the operators take their meaning from algebra rather than syntax.

    Slice 1 ships only [Relation_name] — bare identifiers that resolve to base
    relations. Operators (selection, projection, joins) and literals arrive as
    later slices introduce them. *)

type t =
  | Relation_name of string
      (** [Relation_name name] is a reference to the base relation called [name]
          — the surface syntax is just the bare identifier. *)
